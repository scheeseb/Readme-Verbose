# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a simple tic-tac-toe game built using Node.js and npm. The game can be played in the terminal or command prompt on any platform that supports Node.js.

## Gameplay

The game is simple to play. The objective of the game is to get three of your symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. You play as X and the computer plays as O. Each player takes turns making moves by inputting the number of the square where they want to place their symbol.

For example, if it's your turn and you want to place your symbol in the top left square, you would input "1". If the computer is about to make a move and you want to place your symbol in the bottom right square, you would input "9".

The game ends when one of the players gets three in a row or there are no more available moves. The winner is the first player to get three in a row.
